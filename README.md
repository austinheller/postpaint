# Postpaint

Postpaint lets you add custom CSS to your WordPress posts, pages, and more.

It's really as simple as that: Install the plugin, go to any post (for any post type), and write your CSS. Styles will get added to the `<head>` after all other styles are applied.

Note: Only vanilla CSS alllowed. Any non-CSS tags are automatically stripped.
